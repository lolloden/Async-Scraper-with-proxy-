#  Async-web-scraper-with-proxy

Async web scraper with proxy rotation in Python.

This is a simple web scraper in Python using aiohttp and BeautifulSoup modules.
Since i am relatively new to Python i consider this project as an in-depth study on async programming.
The program is based on tutorials i've found online + answers from stackoverflow.com mixed all together. 
I mention some of them:
- NeuralNine's Rotating Proxies For Web Requests in Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbtCl9jJyyc)
- aiohttp - Splitting task while getting large number of HTML pages.... (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66924831/aiohttp-splitting-task-while-getting-large-number-of-html-pages-runtimeerror)
- Scraping 10,000 records at once with aiohttp (https://www.toughdata.net/blog/post/scrape-10000-records-concurrently-aiohttp)
- Faster web scraping with Python and asyncio  (https://embracingtherandom.com/software/python/faster-web-scraping-with-asyncio/)

There is also a ready-to-go http/https free proxy list that you can use for your needs.

Hope this helps ;)
